      <h3>Hello! I'm Kenisha, an aspiring Creative Director studying at the University of Miami.</h3>
    
      <p><b>My first love was creativity;</b></p>
     <p>At an early age, my definition of fun consisted of exploring different forms of art: from designing to writing, and visual arts. My lifelong relationship with creativity has transformed my adolescent interests into career goals.</p>

     <p>For the past six years, I've been building my portfolio with Strikingly for posting my photography and literary work. Crafting a personal brand while connecting my life experiences with various applications, such as Adobe Creative Studio.</p>
      <p>Currently working towards a bachelor degree at the University of Miami with a double major in journalism and creative advertising, I work as an editor for the 2023 Ibis Yearbook in the academic section and Gravity Magazine.</p>
     
     <p>Outside of college and the office, I enjoy creating YouTube vlogs, indulging in fashion, and traveling! Exploring the cities I've visited has been the highlight of navigating through my early adulthood years...</p>

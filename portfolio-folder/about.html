     <h2>Kenisha Hendricks</h2>
      <h3>Hello! I'm Kenisha, an aspiring Creative Director, author, and travel enthusiast studying at the University of Miami,</h3>
      <p>My first love was creativity;</p>
     <p>At an early age, my definition of fun consisted of exploring different forms of art: from designing to writing, and visual arts. My lifelong relationship with creativity has transformed my adolescent interests into career goals.</p>

     <p>For the past six years, I've been building my portfolio with Strikingly for posting my photography and literary work. Crafting a personal brand while connecting my life experiences with various applications, such as Adobe Creative Studio, has given a unique perspective on social media management and content creation.</p>
      <p>Furthering my education into college, attending classes such as principles of advertising and writing for the digital age have taught business-oriented work, editorial techniques, and strategic communication skills that strengthened my understanding of the field. Currently working towards a bachelor degree at the University of Miami with a double major in journalism and creative advertising, I work as an editor for the 2023 Ibis Yearbook in the academic section and Gravity Magazine. Prior to transferring to UM, I studied at Montclair State University with a major in hospitality, sports, events, and travel while being an intern for the Disney College Program in 2022.</p>
     
     <p>Outside of college and the office, I enjoy creating YouTube vlogs, indulging in fashion, and traveling! Exploring the cities I've visited has been the highlight of navigating through my early adulthood years...</p>

<p>Food was one of my first loves. I've always been drawn to food in various ways: </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Eating</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Learning</li>
        <li>Teaching</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        </ul> 
   
        <p>The crave my mind had to learn more was an understatement. From buying cookbooks to focusing on
restaurants to visit when traveling, being a foodie was an outlet for my self expression. Each dish has its own perspective, origin, and story.</p>
        <p>In 2020, after educating myself about how we consume food as humans, specifically about eating animals, I transitioned my eating habits and became a vegan. Since then, I've prioitized eating healthy, whether incorporating meat or not. </p>
        <p>A magazine project I submitted for my graphic design class in the Fall of 2022 semester was created to hightlight the lifestyle of foodies that also strive for body wellnes. Eating food should make you feel good. Even though my magazine was only for educational purposes and had not been published, my hopes to educate, inform, and inspire people to gain more connection and knowledge about the food being eaten. We can learn a lot about the goods that sprout from the Earth and land on our plates. Health is wealth.</p>
        <p>The spreads that were designed in my magazine highlighted the theme of body wellness. Even though every article explained a different topic, each spread connected back to food. Based in Vegan was tailored to informing readers about veganism, along with Fruitarianism, an exlusive diet only catoring to fruit. Eating the Rainbow was about the importance of including each color of the rainbow into a regime. This can be achieved by eating a variety of legumes, fruits, and vegetables. An Herb of Advice dealt with educating readers about herbs that could be used for medicine and nutritional needs. Furthermore, this article was meant to be a guide for readers to conduct individual research or seek medical input before changing a diet or using new herbs. Lastly, Produce for Beginners was added to teach readers about gardening and growing fresh produce at the convenience of their backyard. </p>

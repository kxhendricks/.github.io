<p>Food was one of my first loves. I've always been drawn to food in various ways: </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Eating</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Learning</li>
        <li>Teaching</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        </ul> 
   
        <p>The crave my mind had to learn more was an understatement. From buying cookbooks to focusing on
restaurants to visit when I would travel, being a foodie was what my heart thrived off of</p>
        <p>In 2020, after educating myself about the omnivore diet, specifically about eating animals, I transitioned into a vegan diet. Since then, I've prioitized eating healthy, whether incorporating meat or not. </p>
        <p>The magazine I had finished for my graphic design class in the Fall of 2022 was created to hightlight the lifestyle of foodies that also strive for body wellnes. Eating food should make you feel good. Even though my magazine was only for educational purposes and had not been published, my hopes to educate, inform, and inspire people to gain more connection and knowledge about the food being eaten. We can learn a lot about the goods that sprout from the Earth and land on our plates. Health is wealth.</p>
